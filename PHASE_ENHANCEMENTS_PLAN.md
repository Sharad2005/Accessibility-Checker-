- Serious: Priority 2
- Moderate: Priority 3
- Minor: Priority 4 (lowest)

**2. User Impact:**
- Issues affecting screen readers: +1 priority
- Issues affecting all users: +1 priority

**3. Remediation Difficulty:**
- Simple (1 line change): Easy
- Moderate (multiple elements): Medium
- Complex (architectural): Hard

**4. Volume:**
- Affecting 1 element: Low volume
- Affecting 5-10 elements: Medium volume
- Affecting 10+ elements: High volume

**Priority Scoring Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Severity √ó 10) + (UserImpact √ó 5) - (Difficulty √ó 2) + (Volume √ó 1)
Higher score = Fix sooner
```

**Time Estimation Database:**

**Per Violation Type:**
- Missing alt text: 2 min per image
- Color contrast: 5 min per element (requires design decision)
- Form labels: 3 min per form field
- List structure: 10 min per list (may need refactoring)
- Page title: 1 min (one-time fix)
- Lang attribute: 1 min (one-time fix)
- Zoom meta tag: 1 min (one-time fix)

**Multipliers:**
- Junior developer: √ó1.5
- Senior developer: √ó1.0
- With AI suggestions: √ó0.5

**Total Estimate Calculation:**
- Sum individual fix times
- Apply multiplier based on developer level
- Round to nearest 15 minutes
- Add 20% buffer for testing

**Decision Points:**
- Use machine learning for better estimates over time?
- Factor in WCAG level (A vs AA vs AAA)?
- Consider fix dependencies (one fix enabling others)?

**Deliverable:** Priority ranking algorithm

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 7.2.1: Demo Script Writing (20 minutes)

**Objective:** 5-minute presentation script

**Structure:**

**Opening Hook (30 seconds):**
> "200 million Indians have disabilities. Yet when we scanned 30 government portals that serve them - portals for scholarships, healthcare, essential services - the average accessibility score was just 42 out of 100. This isn't just bad design. It's digital exclusion that affects millions of our citizens."

**[Show government dashboard with shocking scores]**

**Problem Deep-Dive (1 minute):**
> "Let me show you what this means. This is Karnataka's scholarship portal, used by lakhs of students. Score: 37/100. Missing alt text means blind students can't understand forms. Poor color contrast means low-vision students can't read instructions. No keyboard navigation means motor-impaired students can't even apply."

**[Show specific violation examples, before/after]**

**Solution Demo (2 minutes):**
> "Our tool makes fixing these issues dead simple. Watch - I'll scan IRCTC live right now..."

**[Live scan of pre-selected site]**

> "91/100 - Pretty good! But see these 3 color contrast issues? Let me click 'Get AI Fix Suggestion'..."

**[AI generates suggestion in 3 seconds]**

> "There. AI just wrote the exact code fix. A developer copies this, pastes it, done. Issue fixed in 30 seconds. No research, no guessing."

**[Show before/after code]**

**Impact & Scale (1 minute):**
> "We've built three things:
> 1. This scanner - free, instant, actionable
> 2. A government dashboard - proving the problem with data
> 3. AI fix generator - making solutions accessible to every developer
>
> Every fix makes Digital India safer and more inclusive for 200 million citizens."

**Call to Action (30 seconds):**
> "This is Safe India. Making the digital world accessible isn't optional - it's a fundamental right. Our tool helps developers, governments, and organizations ensure no citizen is left behind."

**[End on government dashboard or strong visual]**

**Backup Points (if time):**
- PDF reports for documentation
- Free tier scaling plan
- Open source potential
- Integration possibilities

**Decision Points:**
- Live demo or pre-recorded video backup?
- Which site to scan live (reliability)?
- How much to say about tech stack?

**Deliverable:** Complete demo script with timing
