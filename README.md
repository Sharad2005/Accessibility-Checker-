## 💡 What Makes This Different?

Unlike traditional accessibility checkers that only identify problems, our tool:

✅ **Generates Real Code Fixes** - Not just descriptions, but actual working HTML/CSS
✅ **Explains the Impact** - Understand how each issue affects users with disabilities
✅ **Teaches Best Practices** - Learn correct implementations while fixing
✅ **Saves Development Time** - Copy-paste ready code instead of researching solutions

### Example AI Suggestion

**Before (Violation):**
```html
<img src="logo.png">
```

**After (AI Fix):**
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo with blue geometric design">
```

**AI Explanation:**
> "Added descriptive alt text that describes the visual content of the image. This helps screen reader users understand what the logo looks like, meeting WCAG 1.1.1 (Non-text Content) requirements."
